I completely forgot about the need to complete this task. 
I remembered when I received the letter in the mail. 
My knowledge is not enough at the moment to create a graphical interface. 
I started studying kiwy on my own, but that’s not enough. 
I thought that in the remaining time I could write a console calendar program since 
I remembered that there was such a task.

My program will save your entries to a file and 
load them when you use the program. 
At the moment, wide functionality is not available, but 
I plan to expand it. All logic will be applicable later. 
You can add a new entry. There are 5 fields available in a record. 
These are date, time, event name, description and priority. 
Also, you will not be able to enter incorrect data, say 12/32/2020. 
You can search for entries by date, importance and event name.

Third-party libraries used are re and time. 
Re is working with regular expressions. 
Checking strings for certain patterns. 
The topic of regular expressions is very broad and 
quite complex. I didn’t understand the end and used 
Time to check the date instead of regular expressions.
